/Users/rezaflutt/Android Trojan/Hermes_Spectre_Edition/dropper_app/app/build.gradle:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/rezaflutt/Android Trojan/Hermes_Spectre_Edition/dropper_app/app/src/main/assets/core_payload.so: Warning: Shared libraries should not be placed in the res or assets directories. Please use the features of your development environment to place shared libraries in the lib directory of the compiled APK. [UnsafeNativeCodeLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnsafeNativeCodeLocation":
   In general, application native code should only be placed in the
   application's library directory, not in other locations such as the res or
   assets directories. Placing the code in the library directory provides
   increased assurance that the code will not be tampered with after
   application installation. Application developers should use the features of
   their development environment to place application native libraries into
   the lib directory of their compiled APKs. Embedding non-shared library
   native executables into applications should be avoided when possible.

/Users/rezaflutt/Android Trojan/Hermes_Spectre_Edition/dropper_app/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26: Warning: This folder configuration (v26) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 26. Merge all the resources in this folder into mipmap-anydpi. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/Users/rezaflutt/Android Trojan/Hermes_Spectre_Edition/dropper_app/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml:3: Warning: The resource R.color.purple_200 appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
    <color name="purple_200">#FFBB86FC</color>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/Users/rezaflutt/Android Trojan/Hermes_Spectre_Edition/dropper_app/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: Warning: The ic_launcher.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.
